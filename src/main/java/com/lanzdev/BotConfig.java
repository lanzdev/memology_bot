/*Hey✋️ Our team is constantly working to improve the functionality and usability of the bot.
Last updates:
1. You will receive such notifications when we release new updates.
2. /pick command is more convenient now. You may either print all publics's ids you want to subscribe to or just click on the links in received list of available publics.
3. /unsubscribe command is supporting the same interface as /pick command so you may act in the same way.
4. /subscribe command allows you to print the whole url of public you want to subscribe to */

/*
Bot has moved, you can rejoin it on @spread_vk_bot. All your settings are already there, so you just need to rejoin it and enjoy our bot again.
